# NLP using Tensorflow to Categorize News Content
In this project, a NLP model from Machine Learning is designed which aims to classify a news text whether it is included in the category of *business, entertainment, politics, sport*, or *tech* news. This project is part of the Fresh Graduate Academy (FGA) training by Digital Talent Scholarship (DTS) with the theme of Machine Learning training, and this training was held by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology of the Republic of Indonesia and IBM.
