# Machine Learning Model For Hourly Energy Consumption (Time Series Data)
In this project, a Machine Learning model is designed to predict hourly power consumption using a series of time series data. This project is part of the Fresh Graduate Academy (FGA) training by Digital Talent Scholarship (DTS) with the theme of Machine Learning training, and this training was held by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology of the Republic of Indonesia and IBM.
