# FIFA 21 Player Position Prediction
Inspired by the project done by [Siddharth](https:///www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/performing-multi-class-classification-on-fifa-dataset-using-keras/) in his article, on this occasion I designed a model using Machine Learning to predict the position of a player in the latest football game, FIFA 21. In this project I also use the prediction results to get a list of players according to position obtained from the prediction results.
