# Rock, Paper, Scissors Image Classification

In this project, a Machine Learning model is designed which aims to classify the image of a hand and predict whether the hand is in a rock, paper, or scissors gesture. This project is part of the Fresh Graduate Academy (FGA) training by Digital Talent Scholarship (DTS) with the theme of Machine Learning training, and this training was held by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology of the Republic of Indonesia and IBM.
