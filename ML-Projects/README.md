| 1 | Rock, Paper, Scissors Image Classification | In this project, a Machine Learning model is designed which aims to classify the image of a hand and predict whether the hand is in a rock, paper, or scissors gesture. This project is part of the Fresh Graduate Academy (FGA) training by Digital Talent Scholarship (DTS) with the theme of Machine Learning training, and this training was held by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology of the Republic of Indonesia and IBM. | ✔️ | [Proj-1](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/tree/main/ML-Projects/RPS-Classification) |
| 2 | NLP using Tensorflow to Categorize News Content |In this project, a NLP model from Machine Learning is designed which aims to classify a news text whether it is included in the category of business, entertainment, politics, sport, or tech news. This project is part of the Fresh Graduate Academy (FGA) training by Digital Talent Scholarship (DTS) with the theme of Machine Learning training, and this training was held by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology of the Republic of Indonesia and IBM. | ✔️ | [Proj-2](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/tree/main/ML-Projects/NLP-NewsContent) |
| 3 | Machine Learning Model For Hourly Energy Consumption (Time Series Data) | In this project, a Machine Learning model is designed to predict hourly power consumption using a series of time series data. This project is part of the Fresh Graduate Academy (FGA) training by Digital Talent Scholarship (DTS) with the theme of Machine Learning training, and this training was held by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology of the Republic of Indonesia and IBM. | ✔️ | [Proj-3](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/tree/main/ML-Projects/Hourly-Energy-Consumption) |
| 4 | FIFA 21 Player Position Prediction | Inspired by the project done by [Siddharth](https:///www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/performing-multi-class-classification-on-fifa-dataset-using-keras/) in his article, on this occasion I designed a model using Machine Learning to predict the position of a player in the latest football game, FIFA 21. In this project I also use the prediction results to get a list of players according to position obtained from the prediction results. | ✔️ | [Proj-4](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/tree/main/ML-Projects/FIFA21-Player-Prediction) |
| 5 | Bank Deposit Subscription Prediction | This project is part of the Machine Learning Zoomcamp training held by DataTalksClub. In this Midterm Project, everything that has been learned in the previous weeks was applied in this project. To see what I have learned during this training, you can refer to this following link. For this project, similar to what has been studied previously (churning and credit risk), the problem raised in this project is the prediction of whether potential bank clients will subscribe to the term deposit or not ('yes' or 'no' condition). | ✔️ | [Proj-5](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/tree/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7) |
