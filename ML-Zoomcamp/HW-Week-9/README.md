# Homework Answer for Week 9 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning)
Week 9 of the #mlzoomcamp explains about Neural Networks and Deep Learning. This week discusses how one of the Deep Learning methods, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be used for dealing with images data, and in this lesson also discusses the use of CNN to predict an image (classification of clothing images)..
