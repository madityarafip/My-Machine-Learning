# MIDTERM PROJECT
This project is part of the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) training held by [DataTalksClub](https://datatalks.club/). In this Midterm Project, everything that has been learned in the previous weeks will be applied in this project. To see what I have learned during this training, you can refer to this following [link](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/tree/main/ML-Zoomcamp).  
For this project, similar to what has been studied previously (churning and credit risk), the problem raised in this project is the prediction of whether potential bank clients will subscribe to the term deposit or not ('yes' or 'no' condition).

## About the Dataset
### Data Source
For this project I use the dataset from here: [https://www.kaggle.com/krantiswalke/bankfullcsv](https://www.kaggle.com/krantiswalke/bankfullcsv), or you can also get the dataset from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/main/Dataset/bank-full.csv).
### Data Description
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to confirm whether potential bank clients will subscribe to the term deposit or not ('yes' or 'no' condition).

## Project Notebooks
 
The notebooks file of this project can be seen in this [link](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/MLZoomcamp_MidProject.ipynb).  
Objective of this project is to create a subscription services to predict the probability whether the potential client will subscribe to a term deposit or not (variable y = yes/no). So in this notebooks, I do some processing before I deploy my model to subscription services. The process includes:
1. Data preparation
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
   What I do in this part: 
    + Check data information
    + Check missing value from the data
    + Change the `'Target'` feature into binary
    + Check if the data is balance or not
    + Look at numerical and categorical features
    + Check unique values in categorical features
    + Visualize numerical features
3. Split dataset ➡️ Train/Val/Test (60%/20%/20%)
4. Features importances  
	 What I do in this part:
	 + View Mutual Info Score for Categorical Features of full train data
	 + Use Correlation Matrix to see correlation between features and target in train data and visualize it using heatmap
5. Choose model  
   The best parameter and model will be selected based on the best performance of the model seen from AUC score of the validation data for each trained model. or this midterm project there are a few model for classification that I used:
   + `LogisticRegression()`
   + `DecisionTreeClassifier()`
   + `RandomForestClassifier()`
   + `XGBoost()`  
   
6. Train the best and final model


## Subscription services codes and tutorial
The codes folder of this project can be seen in this [link](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/tree/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes).  
After the final model is obtained, the next process can be carried out:
1. Create [`train.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/train.py) for training the final model, and also save the final model and `DictVectorizer()` into `final_model.bin` using pickle
2. Putting the model into a web service and deploying it locally with `flask`, `pipenv`, and [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/Dockerfile)
3. Deploying the subscription services to the cloud with docker container using `flask`, `pipenv`, [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/Dockerfile) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

### Tutorial 1 ➡️ Run `train.py` and save the final model and `DictVectorizer()` into `final_model.bin` using pickle
For this part the required file is:
+ [`train.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/train.py)

Steps:
1. Create [`train.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/train.py) by exporting the notebook into a python script
2. Open terminal in project folder
3. Run [`train.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/train.py) in terminal using this command:  
   	`python3 train.py`
5. Wait until training process complete
6. And there you have it! The model and `DictVectorizer()` are saved into `final_model.bin`

All of the steps and process can be seen in the video below ⬇️

**Note**: 
+ For example of saving and loading the model using `pickle` you can refer to this lesson: [5.2. Saving and loading the model](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/blob/master/course-zoomcamp/05-deployment/02-pickle.md)

### Customer Data
For **Tutorial 2** and **Tutorial 3** we need potential client data to look at the probabilty prediction generated by the model. For this project I used 2 client data as written below:
1. Client ID: 12-MaD  
   ```
   client_data = {
            "age": 28, 
            "marital": "single",
            "job": "technician", 
            "default": "no", 
            "balance": 4000, 
            "housing": "no",
            "loan": "no", 
            "campaign": 3, 
            "previous": 0
             }
   ```
2. Client ID: 31-ArP  
   ```
   client_data = {
            "age": 40, 
            "marital": "married",
            "job": "entrepreneur", 
            "default": "no", 
            "balance": 6000, 
            "housing": "yes",
            "loan": "no", 
            "campaign": 8, 
            "previous": 1
             }   
   ```
### Tutorial 2 ➡️ Put model into a web services and deploy it locally with `pipenv` and `Dockerfile`
For this part the required files are:
+ [`predict.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/predict.py)
+ `final_model.bin`
+ `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`
+ `Dockerfile`
+ [`test_local.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/test_local.py)

Steps:
1. Create [`predict.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/predict.py) for load the `final_model.bin` and send the probability prediction result using `flask`
2. Open terminal in project folder and install `pipenv` for python virtual envinronment using this command:  
   		`pip install pipenv`
3. After the `pipenv` installation complete you can install the python libraries that used in this project using this command:  
   		`pipenv install scikit-learn==1.0.0 numpy flask requests gunicorn xgboost`
4. After installing the libraries the process will generate 2 files `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`
5. Create `Dockerfile` with the contents of the script as below  
   ``` 
   FROM python:3.9.7-slim
      
   RUN pip install pipenv

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY ["Pipfile", "Pipfile.lock", "./"]

   RUN pipenv install --system --deploy

   COPY ["predict.py", "final_model.bin", "./"]

   EXPOSE 1208

   ENTRYPOINT ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:1208", "predict:app"] 
   ```
6. Build Docker container using this command:  
   	       `sudo docker build -t mid-pro-mlz .`  
   With -t command we're specifying the tag mid-pro-mlz for this Dockerfile.	       
   You can see this process in this video below ⬇️
   
   
   

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42953630/139566978-ef241014-12e9-4bce-8bc7-9f1897555645.mp4


   

7. After the Docker container is build, we can run it, just simply used this command:  
   `sudo docker run -it -p 1208:1208 mid-pro-mlz:latest`  
   Here we use the option -it in order to the Docker run from terminal and shows the result. The -p parameter is used to map the 1208 port of the Docker to 1208 port of our machine. (First 1208 is the Docker container port and the last 1208 is port number for our machine)
8. The docker run subscription services and wait for input from client data from [`test_local.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/test_local.py)
9. Run the [`test_local.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/test_local.py) in another terminal (need to open new terminal from project folder) using this command:  
   `pipenv run python test_local.py`
10. Fill the form of potential client data
11. Wait for the probability prediction process
12. And congratulation! You can get the subsription probability for the potential client and get the suggestion from system whether we need to send email offer or not (For this project I give condition to send email when the probability is >= 70%)

For step 7 - 10 you can see the process in this video below ⬇️

### Tutorial 3 ➡️ Put the web subscription services to the cloud with docker container using Heroku
For this part the required files are:
+ [`predict.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/predict.py)
+ `final_model.bin`
+ `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`
+ [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/Dockerfile)
+ [`test_cloud.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/test_cloud.py)

Steps:
1. Create [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) account
2. Install Heroku CLI
3. Login to Heroku using CLI via terminal using this command:  
   `heroku login`
4. Login to Heroku container registry in terminal using this command:  
   `heroku container:login`
5. Still in the same terminal, create app in Heroku using this command:  
   `heroku create mid-proj-docker`
6. Edit the `Dockerfile`, because heroku can't specify which port we will use, so instead  
   `ENTRYPOINT ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:1208", "predict:app"]`  
   we change that line into
   `ENTRYPOINT ["gunicorn", "predict:app"]`
7. Push docker image to Heroku using this command:  
   `heroku container:push web -a mid-proj-docker`  
   For step 6 and 7 you can see in this video below ⬇️
   
   

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42953630/139568770-3e891927-cebb-4ac9-b9f9-65a6da3e1e9b.mp4


   
   

8. Release the container using this command:  
   `heroku container:release web -a mid-proj-docker`
9. Launch you app to check whether the Docker container is successfully deployed or not (for this project you can click this URL: [https://mid-proj-docker.herokuapp.com/welcome](https://mid-proj-docker.herokuapp.com/welcome))
10. If the Docker container successfully deployed then you can proceed to the next step
11. Open new terminal and run [`test_cloud.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/test_cloud.py) (the different from [`test_local.py`](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML-Zoomcamp/Midterm-Project-Week-7/Mid-Project-Codes/test_local.py) is the desired destination URL, and for this step the URL used is `"http://mid-proj-docker.herokuapp.com/predict"`) 
12. Fill the form of potential client data
13. Wait for the probability prediction process
14. And congratulation! You can get the subsription probability for the potential client and get the suggestion from system whether we need to send email offer or not (For this project I give condition to send email when the probability is >= 70%)

For step 8 - 10 you can see the process in this video below ⬇️
