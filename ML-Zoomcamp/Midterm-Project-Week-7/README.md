# Midterm Project
This project is part of the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) training held by [DataTalksClub](https://datatalks.club/). In this Midterm Project, everything that has been learned in the previous weeks will be applied in this project. To see what I have learned during this training, you can refer to the following [link](https://github.com/madityarafip/My-Machine-Learning/tree/main/ML-Zoomcamp).
