# Homework Answer for Week 4 (Evaluation Metrics for Classification)
Week 4 of the #mlzoomcamp explains about evaluation metrics such as ROC, AUC, accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate the trained model performance. This week also explains about folds using `KFold()` for various training-test set.
